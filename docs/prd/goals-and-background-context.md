# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a zero-friction, offline photo aggregation system that transforms passive event photography into active guest entertainment
- Enable event venues to differentiate their offerings and justify premium pricing through unique technology features
- Eliminate venue staff burden through fully automated, plug-and-play operation requiring no technical expertise
- Provide comprehensive memory capture for event hosts by aggregating photos from all guest perspectives
- Establish product-market fit with casual event venues and planners within 3-6 months
- Build commercial credibility and track record to enable expansion into corporate event and memorial service markets

## Background Context

Image-Share addresses a fundamental gap in the event industry: guests capture hundreds of photos at social gatherings, but these remain isolated on individual devices, providing no real-time entertainment value and creating fragmented memories for hosts. Existing solutions fail due to internet dependency, high costs, or poor adoption from app-required platforms. Meanwhile, event venues struggle with commoditization, competing primarily on price in the absence of unique differentiators.

The solution leverages commercially-viable Raspberry Pi hardware to create a self-contained, offline photo display system. Guests connect to a dedicated Wi-Fi network, upload photos via browser (no app required), and see them appear on a central display within seconds. This transforms photography from passive documentation into active participation, creates ambient entertainment throughout events, and gives venues a marketable premium feature. The B2B channel model targets venues and professional event planners who benefit from operational efficiency and differentiation, while ultimately serving event hosts seeking comprehensive memory preservation and guest engagement.
