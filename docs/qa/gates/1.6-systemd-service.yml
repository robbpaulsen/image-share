# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.6: Systemd Service Configuration and Automated Startup
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Systemd Service Configuration and Automated Startup"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality, but 4 manual hardware tests (cold boot, auto-restart, logging, Epic 1 integration) remain incomplete due to requiring physical Raspberry Pi. Gate will upgrade to PASS once hardware validation completes."

  highest: "medium - untested hardware validation"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Complete cold boot test (AC6) - verify 3.5 minute startup on hardware"
      - "Complete automatic restart test (AC7) - verify 15s recovery after kill -9"
      - "Complete journald logging test (AC8) - verify logs visible via journalctl"
      - "Complete Epic 1 integration test (Task 9) - full system validation"
    monitor:
      - "Monitor actual startup timing in production - may need to adjust 180s delay"
      - "Consider adding After=hostapd.service if Wi-Fi AP is separate service"

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Service runs as non-root (pi user), proper file permissions, environment file not committed, port 8000 with iptables forwarding option documented"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "180s startup delay appropriate for network init, RestartSec=10 enables 15s recovery, health check has 5s timeout"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Automatic restart on failure, proper dependency ordering (After=network.target), journald logging, health check monitoring, installation validation"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - clear scripts with step-by-step output, comprehensive docs with troubleshooting, automated regression tests, systemd best practices, modular design"

# Implementation strengths
strengths:
  - "Exceptionally thorough deployment documentation (487 lines with complete troubleshooting)"
  - "Robust error handling in all scripts (set -e, validation checks)"
  - "Comprehensive automated configuration testing (10/10 tests passing in 0.02s)"
  - "Security-conscious design (non-root execution, proper permissions)"
  - "Excellent operational tooling (health check, status scripts)"
  - "Production-ready systemd configuration following best practices"
  - "Clear separation between automated and manual testing"
  - "Infrastructure as Code approach with version control"

# Context notes
notes: |
  This CONCERNS gate is procedural, not quality-based. The implementation is excellent and production-ready.

  The story involves deploying system-level infrastructure on embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi), which inherently
  requires manual validation that cannot be automated without a CI/CD pipeline with actual hardware. The development
  team correctly identified these limitations and documented thorough manual testing procedures in the deployment guide.

  All acceptance criteria are either fully validated (AC1-5, AC9-10) or have documented test procedures ready for
  hardware execution (AC6-8). The code, configuration, scripts, tests, and documentation are all production-grade.

  Once the 4 manual hardware tests (Tasks 5, 6, 7, 9) are executed successfully, this gate should be upgraded to PASS.
  No code changes are anticipated - this is pure validation work.
