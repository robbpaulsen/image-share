  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-critical functionality in scope. Foundation story with health check only."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health endpoint responds in <10ms. Directory creation is one-time startup operation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust directory creation with parents=True, exist_ok=True. FastAPI handles errors gracefully."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, comprehensive docstrings, follows all coding standards. Modern lifespan pattern used."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "apps/api/main.py"
    change: "Replaced deprecated @app.on_event with lifespan context manager"
    rationale: "Eliminates deprecation warnings and follows FastAPI modern practices"
  - file: "apps/api/tests/test_main.py"
    change: "Added pytest import and converted to fixture-based TestClient"
    rationale: "Fixes missing import and improves test isolation"
