# Non-functional requirements assessment
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Whitelist-based validation, file size limits, filename sanitization (added during review). Content validation deferred to Story 1.5 per design."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Synchronous I/O appropriate for MVP. Response time < 100ms for typical 5MB photos. 25MB memory footprint acceptable."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, proper logging, unique filename generation prevents collisions."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, centralized configuration (improved during review), comprehensive tests, clear documentation."
