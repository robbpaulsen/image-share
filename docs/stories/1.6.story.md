# Story 1.6: Systemd Service Configuration and Automated Startup

## Status
**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** venue staff member,
**I want** the system to start automatically when I plug in the device,
**So that** I don't need technical knowledge or manual intervention to get it operational.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Systemd service file created at `/etc/systemd/system/image-share.service`
2. Service configured with 180-second (3-minute) delayed start (`ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 180`) to allow network initialization
3. Service runs backend server (Uvicorn) as non-root user with appropriate permissions
4. Service configured for automatic restart on failure (`Restart=on-failure`, `RestartSec=10`)
5. Service enabled to start on boot (`systemctl enable image-share.service`)
6. Test: Cold boot of Raspberry Pi results in service running and accessible within 3.5 minutes of power-on
7. Test: Manually killing the backend process (`kill -9 <PID>`) results in automatic restart within 15 seconds
8. Service logs to journald; logs viewable with `journalctl -u image-share.service -f`
9. Health check script validates service is responding correctly (HTTP GET to `/health` returns 200)
10. Documentation includes: starting/stopping service manually, viewing logs, checking service status, troubleshooting startup failures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Assumptions from Stories 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5** (completed):
- **Story 1.1**: Project foundation established with a FastAPI backend.
- **Story 1.3**: A photo upload API endpoint is functional.
- **Story 1.4**: A mobile-optimized upload interface is available.
- **Story 1.5**: A background photo processing pipeline (rename/move) is implemented.
- **Environment Assumption**: The application runs on a device pre-configured with a Wi-Fi Access Point and network services. This functionality is outside the scope of the application development.

**Note**: The carousel-ui display interface is NOT part of Epic 1. It will be implemented in Epic 2. This story focuses solely on making the backend API and upload UI start automatically.

### Architecture Overview

This story implements the final piece of Epic 1: automatic system startup using systemd on the Raspberry Pi. The goal is to enable venue staff to simply plug in the device and have it operational within 3.5 minutes without any manual intervention.

**Deployment Platform**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
[Source: section-14-deployment-architecture.md#141]

**Process Manager**: systemd (OS-provided)
- Robust, built-in OS tool for service management
- Ensures backend process runs on boot and restarts on failure
[Source: section-3-tech-stack.md]

**Deployment Method**: Git clone + uv pip install + systemd activation
[Source: section-14-deployment-architecture.md#141]

### Systemd Service Configuration Requirements

**Service File Location**: `/etc/systemd/system/image-share.service`
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 1]

**Startup Delay**: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Required to allow the underlying OS network services to fully initialize before the application starts.
- Implemented using `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 180`
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 2]

**User Configuration**: Non-root user (typically `pi`)
- Service must NOT run as root for security reasons
- User must have appropriate file permissions for project directory and image directories
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 3]

**Restart Policy**: Automatic restart on failure
- `Restart=on-failure` - restart only if process exits with error
- `RestartSec=10` - wait 10 seconds before restarting
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 4]

**Boot Behavior**: Enabled for automatic startup
- Service must be enabled with `systemctl enable image-share.service`
- Configured with `WantedBy=multi-user.target` in [Install] section
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 5]

### Systemd Service File Template

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Image-Share Photo Upload System
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/image-share
EnvironmentFile=/home/pi/image-share/apps/api/.env
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 180
ExecStart=/home/pi/image-share/.venv/bin/uvicorn apps.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Key Configuration Notes**:
- `After=network.target` ensures network subsystem is ready before starting
- `Type=simple` is appropriate for uvicorn (doesn't fork/daemonize)
- `StandardOutput=journal` and `StandardError=journal` route logs to journald
- Absolute path to uvicorn binary within virtual environment is required

### Port Configuration Considerations

**Port 80 vs Port 8000**:
- Production URL is `http://10.0.17.1/` (port 80) per architecture
- Binding to port 80 requires root privileges OR capabilities configuration
- Options:
  1. Use `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep'` on Python interpreter to allow non-root port 80 binding
  2. Run service on port 8000 and configure iptables port forwarding: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000`
  3. Use nginx as reverse proxy (adds complexity, not needed for MVP)

**Recommended Approach**: Use port 8000 with iptables redirect for simplicity and security.

### Environment Configuration

**Environment File**: `/home/pi/image-share/apps/api/.env`
[Source: section-13-development-workflow.md#132]

Required variables (from Story 1.1):
```bash
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
PHOTO_DIR_DISPLAY="/image-share-data/display_images"
PHOTO_DIR_RAW="/image-share-data/raw_images"
PHOTO_DIR_FAILED="/image-share-data/failed_images"
```

**Important**: Ensure `.env` file is present on the Raspberry Pi before starting the service. This should be part of deployment setup, not committed to git.

### Monitoring and Logging

**Monitoring Stack**: systemd + journalctl
[Source: section-19-monitoring-and-observability.md#191]

**Log Viewing Commands**:
- Real-time logs: `journalctl -u image-share.service -f`
- Recent logs: `journalctl -u image-share.service -n 100`
- Logs since time: `journalctl -u image-share.service --since "10 minutes ago"`
- Logs with priority: `journalctl -u image-share.service -p err`

**Application Logging**: Python logging module configured to output to stdout/stderr, which systemd captures and routes to journald
[Source: section-3-tech-stack.md]

### Health Check Script Requirements

**Script Location**: `scripts/health-check.sh`
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.6 AC 9]

**Script Purpose**: Validate that the service is responding correctly by checking the health endpoint

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Perform HTTP GET to `http://localhost/health` (or appropriate port)
- Parse JSON response and verify `status: "ok"` field
- Exit with code 0 for success, non-zero for failure
- Include timeout (e.g., 5 seconds)
- Provide clear output messages

**Example Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -m 5 http://localhost/health)
STATUS=$(echo $RESPONSE | grep -o '"status":"ok"')
if [ -n "$STATUS" ]; then
  echo "✓ Health check passed: Service is operational"
  exit 0
else
  echo "✗ Health check failed: Service not responding correctly"
  echo "Response: $RESPONSE"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Testing Requirements

**Cold Boot Test** (AC: 6):
- Complete power cycle of Raspberry Pi
- Service must be operational within 3.5 minutes (180s delay + ~30s boot + service startup)
- All components accessible: health endpoint, upload UI
- Test on actual Raspberry Pi hardware, not emulation

**Failure Recovery Test** (AC: 7):
- Kill uvicorn process with `kill -9 <PID>`
- Service must automatically restart within 15 seconds
- System must return to fully operational state
- Verify via health endpoint and service status

**Log Verification** (AC: 8):
- Application logs visible in journald
- Logs include startup messages, request logs, error logs
- Log retention appropriate for device storage constraints

### Production Environment Details

**Environments** (from architecture):
- **Development**: `http://localhost:8000/` (developer machine)
- **Staging**: `http://10.0.17.1/` (dedicated Raspberry Pi for testing)
- **Production**: `http://10.0.17.1/` (devices deployed at events)
[Source: section-14-deployment-architecture.md#143]

This story targets the Staging and Production environments (Raspberry Pi devices).

### File Permissions and Ownership

**Project Directory Ownership**:
```bash
sudo chown -R pi:pi /home/pi/image-share
```

**Image Directory Permissions**:
- Service user must have write permissions to create and delete files
- Directories: `raw_images/`, `display_images/`, `failed_images/`
- Consider using `/image-share-data/` prefix for production (as per .env config)

**Service File Permissions**:
```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/image-share.service
```

### Documentation Requirements

**Documentation Location**: Update README.md or create docs/deployment.md

**Required Documentation Sections** (AC: 10):
1. Service Management Commands (start, stop, restart, status, enable, disable)
2. Log Viewing and Monitoring
3. Troubleshooting Guide covering:
   - Service fails to start (check journalctl for errors)
   - Permission denied errors (verify file ownership and permissions)
   - Port binding failures (check port availability, consider port forwarding)
   - Network not ready at startup (adjust ExecStartPre delay if needed)
   - Service crashes after startup (check application logs, verify dependencies)
   - Health check fails (verify network, check firewall rules)

### Integration with Previous Stories

**Story 1.5 Integration** (Photo Processing):
- The photo processing pipeline (renaming and moving files) runs as a background task within the main backend application.
- The processing loop starts automatically when the service starts.
- No separate systemd service is needed for the processor, as it is part of the main `image-share.service`.

### Deployment Workflow

**Initial Deployment Steps** (for reference, not part of this story's code):
1. Clone repository: `git clone <repo-url> /home/pi/image-share`
2. Create virtual environment: `cd /home/pi/image-share && uv venv`
3. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r apps/api/requirements.txt`
4. Create .env file with production configuration
5. Create systemd service file (this story)
6. Enable and start service (this story)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Review Summary

This re-review confirms the previous assessment. The quality of the code, configuration, automated tests, and documentation remains **EXCELLENT**. No code changes or refactoring are required.

The gate status remains **CONCERNS** for the same reason as the previous review: critical acceptance criteria (AC6, AC7, AC8) and their corresponding tasks (5, 6, 7, 9) require manual testing on physical Raspberry Pi hardware. These tests have not yet been completed.

### Assessment

- **Code & Documentation Quality**: No issues. The work is production-grade.
- **Automated Testing**: Excellent. The configuration tests in `test_service_config.py` are a model for infrastructure validation.
- **Outstanding Work**: Manual hardware validation is the only blocking item to move this story to "Done".

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/1.6-systemd-service-automated-startup.yml`

**Reason for CONCERNS:**
- Incomplete Validation: Acceptance Criteria 6, 7, and 8 are not verified.
- Pending Tasks: Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 9 are incomplete.

This is a procedural gate. The artifacts themselves are of high quality. The gate can be moved to `PASS` once the manual hardware tests are successfully executed and documented by the development team.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Hardware testing must be completed as per the procedures in `docs/deployment.md`.

**Story owner decides final status.**


### Review Date: 2025-10-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Escalation Factors:**

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Level Appropriateness: EXCELLENT**

The test strategy correctly separates concerns:

1. **Unit Tests (Configuration Validation):** 10 tests in `test_service_config.py`
   - Validates systemd service file structure and content
   - Checks required files exist (scripts, documentation)
   - Fast, deterministic, no hardware dependencies
   - **Appropriate for:** Configuration validation and regression prevention

2. **Integration Tests (Manual Hardware Tests):** Documented procedures
   - Cold boot test (Task 5)
   - Automatic restart test (Task 6)
   - Journald logging test (Task 7)
   - Full Epic 1 integration test (Task 9)
   - **Appropriate for:** Hardware-dependent behavior that cannot be mocked

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
- ✓ Configuration: 100% (all service directives validated)
- ✓ Scripts: 100% (existence validated, functionality tested manually)
- ✓ Documentation: 100% (existence and content checks)
- ⚠ Hardware Integration: 0% (requires manual testing on Raspberry Pi)

**Test Reliability:** All automated tests are deterministic and fast (0.02s total).

**Test Maintainability:** Tests are well-organized, clearly named, and use good pytest practices.

### Compliance Check

✓ **Coding Standards** (section-17-coding-standards.md)
- File naming: ✓ `snake_case.py` for Python tests, kebab-case for systemd service
- Error handling: ✓ Installation script uses `set -e` and validation checks
- Documentation: ✓ Comprehensive deployment guide

✓ **Testing Strategy** (section-16-testing-strategy.md)
- Backend tests in `/apps/api/tests/`: ✓ Present
- Manual E2E checklists: ✓ Documented in deployment.md

✓ **Security Requirements** (section-15-security-and-performance.md)
- Input validation: ✓ Not applicable (infrastructure configuration)
- Non-root execution: ✓ Service runs as `pi` user (AC3)

✓ **All Acceptance Criteria Met**: 10/10
- AC1-AC5, AC9-AC10: ✓ Fully implemented and validated
- AC6-AC8: ⚠ Implemented but require manual hardware testing (documented)

**Controllability: HIGH**
- Service can be started, stopped, restarted, and killed for testing
- Startup delay can be adjusted if network initialization time changes
- Health check URL is configurable via environment variable

**Observability: EXCELLENT**
- Service status visible via `systemctl status`
- Logs accessible via `journalctl` with multiple filtering options
- Health check provides programmatic validation
- Status script provides comprehensive operational view

**Debuggability: EXCELLENT**
- Detailed logging to journald
- Installation script provides clear error messages
- Health check script outputs detailed failure information
- Troubleshooting guide covers common failure scenarios with diagnostic commands

### Technical Debt Identification

**None Identified.** The implementation is production-ready with no shortcuts or known issues.

**Future Considerations (Not Blocking):**
1. Consider adding `After=hostapd.service dnsmasq.service` if Wi-Fi services are separate systemd units (noted in service file comments)
2. Monitor actual startup time in production - may need to adjust 180s delay
3. Consider implementing automated hardware testing in CI if Raspberry Pi test infrastructure becomes available

### Refactoring Performed

**None required.** The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices. No refactoring was necessary.

### Improvements Checklist

All items below were handled by the development team:

- [x] Systemd service file properly configured (infrastructure/image-share.service)
- [x] Installation script with error handling and validation (scripts/install-service.sh)
- [x] Health check script with timeout and error reporting (scripts/health-check.sh)
- [x] Service status convenience script (scripts/service-status.sh)
- [x] Comprehensive automated tests (apps/api/tests/test_service_config.py)
- [x] Thorough deployment documentation (docs/deployment.md)
- [x] README updated with deployment guide reference

**Outstanding Items (Manual Testing Required on Hardware):**
- [ ] Task 5: Cold boot test on Raspberry Pi (AC6)
- [ ] Task 6: Automatic restart test on Raspberry Pi (AC7)
- [ ] Task 7: Journald logging verification on Raspberry Pi (AC8)
- [ ] Task 9: Full Epic 1 integration test on Raspberry Pi

### Files Modified During Review

**No files were modified during this review.** The implementation was production-ready as submitted.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.6-systemd-service.yml

**Risk Profile:** Low risk for implemented components, medium risk for untested hardware validation

**Reason for CONCERNS (Not PASS):**
Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 9 remain incomplete due to requiring physical Raspberry Pi hardware testing. While all code, configuration, and documentation are production-ready, the acceptance criteria explicitly require validation of cold boot behavior, automatic restart, logging, and full system integration on actual hardware.

**Note:** This is a procedural CONCERNS gate, not a quality concern. The implementation is excellent and ready for hardware testing. Once hardware tests pass, this gate can be upgraded to PASS.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Hardware testing must be completed before marking story as Done

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to Raspberry Pi staging/test device
2. Execute Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 9 following procedures in docs/deployment.md
3. Document actual timing results (cold boot time, restart time)
4. Verify any adjustments needed for startup delay
5. Update story with test results in Dev Agent Record
6. Request final QA approval after hardware validation

**Story owner decides final status.**

### Quality Score

**85/100**

Calculation: 100 - (10 × 1 CONCERNS) - (5 × 1 incomplete validation) = 85

**Breakdown:**
- Configuration: 100/100 (perfect)
- Code Quality: 100/100 (excellent)
- Documentation: 100/100 (comprehensive)
- Test Coverage: 60/100 (automated tests complete, manual hardware tests pending)

### Additional Observations

**Strengths:**
1. Exceptionally thorough documentation - deployment guide is production-grade
2. Robust error handling in all scripts
3. Comprehensive automated testing of configuration
4. Security-conscious design (non-root execution, proper permissions)
5. Excellent operational tooling (health check, status script)
6. Clear separation of concerns between automated and manual testing

**Best Practices Demonstrated:**
1. Infrastructure as Code approach with version-controlled service files
2. Idempotent installation script with validation checks
3. Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
4. Automated regression prevention via configuration tests
5. Clear communication of system state via logging and status tools

**Context for CONCERNS Gate:**
This story involves deploying system-level infrastructure on embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi), which inherently requires manual validation that cannot be automated without a CI/CD pipeline with actual hardware. The development team correctly identified these limitations and documented thorough manual testing procedures. The CONCERNS gate reflects incomplete validation, not code quality issues.
